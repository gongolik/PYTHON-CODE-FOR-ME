STRING -----You have to enclose it with single or double quote.
>>> a='sunil'
>>> print(a)
sunil

print("Olugbenga 'Lekan' Alawode")
Olugbenga 'Lekan' Alawode

>>> print('Olugbenga "Lekan" Alawode')
Olugbenga "Lekan" Alawode
>>>
MULTI-LINE STRING LITERALS----When you want the string lines to be display in multiple lines then you used three single quotes (''')
>>> a= '''Logiclabs
...                Technologies'''
>>> print(a)
Logiclabs
               Technologies
>>>

USING INDEX IN STRINGS-----Index will help you access any character or alphaebeth in the string.Index number starts with 0. You must always put it in square bracket
Index will give you one character to be printed.

a = 'olugbenga '
print ( a[0] )
o
print( a[4] )
b

SLICE-----Getting some characters from the whole string. a[beginning index: ending index]
NOTE: The ending index is always end-1 i.e in the below example, the olugbenga character is 8 but for us to get the 8 characters, we have to use 9 at the ending index.
OR for you to get 4, you must use 5 at the ending index
print ( a[0:9] )
olugbenga

print ( a[0:5] )
olugb

Note, if you do not specify the begin index, then the default value is 0. So you don't get no error if you do not mention any value at the begining index
print ( a[:9 ] )
olugbenga 

Note, If you do not specify the ending index, then it returns All charrcters till end of the string
print ( a[0: ] )
olugbenga 

Note, If you do not specify the beginning and the ending index, it gives you the entire string. Just like you are writing print(a)

LEN-------
print( len(a) )
10
NOTE, All what we have been doing above is positive Index

NEGATIVE INDEX----This will start from the last character. and it start with -1 which is a, -2 which is g etc
>>> print(a[-1])
a
>>> print(a[-2])
g
>>>
You can always use positive and negative index to get your character
CONVERTING from Lower case to Upper case or From Upper case to lower case
Example to convert from olugbenga to Olugbenga, we have to use Upper function to make the first character to be capital letter O
print( a[0].upper() )
O
 
print ( a[4].upper() )
B
Now, you have print the first letter to be Capital letter O, To print all the remaining letters in smaller letters using slicing.
print ( a[0].upper() + a[1:] )
Olugbenga 

print ( a[0: len(a) -1] + a[-1].upper() )
'olugbengA '
