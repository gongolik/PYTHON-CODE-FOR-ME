Collection of data are obejects(variables and functions) that are subject to change when it is modify and the object changes. COllection of data includes: List, turple, set, frozen set, dict, byte bytearray.
Collection data type are mutable in nature. collection data type can take and accept multiple values.

List is heterogeneous in nature i.e it can hold multiple values

LIST
a = [ 10, 'ada', 20, 30, 'true']
print (type(a))
<class 'list'>
# using indexing with list to access the first element
print ( a[0] )
10
# accessing the second index
print ( a[1] )
ada
#Aceesing the last insex
print ( a[-1] )
true

Turple is a collection of data. it is heterogeneous in nature just like list but the only diffference is that turple is immutable.The difference between list and turple is turple uses bracket
Turple also accept indexing and order in nature. The only thing is that you cannot modify the value of turole thereby making it immutable. Turple is read only.
Turple is immutable, you cannot append or remove value from turple.
  
c = ( 10, 'ada', 20, 30, 'true' )
print (type(c) )
<class 'tuple'>

print (c)
(10, 'ada', 20, 30, 'true')

Turple is immutable, you cannot change, append or remove value from turple. it will give you error if you try to.
c[0] = 500
ERROR: Traceback (most recent call last):
  File "<pyshell#27>", line 1, in <module>

TypeError: 'tuple' object does not support item assignment
