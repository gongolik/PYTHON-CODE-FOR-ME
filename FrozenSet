This is the same as set but it is Immutable unlike set that is mutable. In frozenset, you cannot Add or Remove because it is immutable
# FrozenSet....Althouh, when doing frozenset, you still have to pass a set as an input you are going to use to get the frozenset. a is Set and b is frozenset
a = {10,20,30,40}
b = frozenset(a)
print (type(b))
<class 'frozenset'>
