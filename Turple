Turple is a collection of data. it is heterogeneous in nature just like list but the only diffference is that turple is immutable.The difference between list and turple is turple uses bracket
Turple also accept indexing and order in nature. The only thing is that you cannot modify the value of turole thereby making it immutable. Turple is read only.
Turple is immutable, you cannot append or remove value from turple.
  
c = ( 10, 'ada', 20, 30, 'true' )
print (type(c) )
<class 'tuple'>

print (c)
(10, 'ada', 20, 30, 'true')

Turple is immutable, you cannot change, append or remove value from turple. it will give you error if you try to.
c[0] = 500
